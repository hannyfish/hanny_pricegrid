## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I was really tempted to do this with FLex but decided to continue practicing with Grid. It was pretty irritating trying to figure out lengths and widths, so I kind of freestyled based on what I thought looked good on both desktop and mobile. 

I used Flexbox to align the content within the grid files as I was worried about using padding and how it would interfere with the widths, so even though it did bloat out the HTML a bit more it did make everything far neater and better aligned. 

Ended up picking the grayblue accent for the hover button colour as it was the only one that looked semi-decent!

### Continued development

Eventually I want to start branching out into the tougher challenges with CSS and HTML, especially as I don't know Javascript and am loathe to start learning just yet, although I've used it before. I'm mostly hoping I can begin to consolidate Grid a lot easier than I'm currently finding it as it is a really useful bit of code!
